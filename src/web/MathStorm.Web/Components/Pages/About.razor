                            <p>
                                Math Storm is a fast-paced mathematical game designed to test and improve your mental arithmetic skills. 
                                Too often these days we let the computers and calculators and phones do all of the mental arithmetic for us,
                                and that skill of being able to estimate with mental math is a skill that is quickly fading away and needs
                                to be developed in order to succeed in life.

                                Challenge yourself across four difficulty levels, from beginner-friendly addition and subtraction to 
                                expert-level multi-digit calculations involving all four basic operations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The game emphasizes both speed and accuracy, with a unique scoring system where lower scores are better. 
                                Race against the clock to solve mathematical problems as quickly and accurately as possible!

                                    <p>
                                        Math Storm was inspired by a simple computer game that I played when I was first 
                                        introduced to computers, back when that first computer was actually a teletype terminal that 
                                        had no screen but every response and reply was printed on printer paper.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In those early days of computing, when interactions were limited to text-based commands and 
                                        printed responses, simple mathematical games provided an engaging way to practice arithmetic 
                                        while exploring the capabilities of these revolutionary machines. The tactile experience of 
                                        watching calculations appear on paper, character by character, created a unique connection 
                                        between human and machine.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Math Storm brings that same spirit of mathematical challenge and discovery to the modern web, 
                                        combining the timeless appeal of mental arithmetic with contemporary web technologies. While 
                                        we've moved far beyond teletype terminals, the fundamental joy of solving mathematical problems 
                                        quickly and accurately remains unchanged.
