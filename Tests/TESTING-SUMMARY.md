- ✅ Performance benchmarks and error handling

### 3. Manual Test Harness ✅ COMPLETE
**Location:** `TestHarness/`
**Status:** Comprehensive manual testing documentation and tools

#### Components:
- **MathStorm-Manual-Test-Plan.md**: 13 detailed test categories
- **MathStorm-API-Integration-Tests.md**: Service and integration testing
- **MathStorm-HTTP-Tests.http**: REST client testing scenarios
- **README.md**: Complete testing suite documentation

#### Manual Test Categories:
1. Home Page and UI Tests
2. Game Flow Tests (all difficulty levels)
3. Responsive Design Tests
4. Input and Navigation Tests
5. Performance Tests
6. Browser Compatibility Tests
7. Accessibility Tests

#### HTTP/API Testing:
- 28 HTTP test scenarios
- Static resource validation
- Blazor Server SignalR endpoint testing
- Security header validation
- Performance benchmarking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Infrastructure:
- **Framework**: MSTest for unit tests, Playwright for UI tests
- **Languages**: C# for unit tests, TypeScript for Playwright tests
- **Configuration**: Updated Playwright config for correct test paths
- **CI/CD Ready**: All tests can be integrated into build pipelines

### Game Logic Validation:
- **Difficulty Settings**: 
  - Beginner: 5 questions, 2-digit numbers, +/- only
  - Novice: 5 questions, 2-digit numbers, all operations
  - Intermediate: 10 questions, 3-digit numbers, all operations
  - Expert: 10 questions, 4-digit numbers, all operations

- **Scoring Algorithm**: 
  ```
  Score = (PercentageDifference × Time) + (Time × TimeFactor)
  TimeFactor = 10 (normal), 100 (speed penalty for < 1 second)
  ```

### Quality Assurance:
- ✅ All unit tests pass with 100% success rate
- ✅ Comprehensive edge case testing
- ✅ Performance baseline validation
- ✅ Accessibility compliance testing
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility scenarios

## Execution Instructions

### Quick Validation (5 minutes):
```bash
# Run unit tests
cd src/MathStorm && dotnet test

# Start application for manual testing
cd src/MathStorm/MathStorm.Web && dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:5000"

# Manual smoke test: Complete one game of each difficulty
```

### Full Test Suite (30 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Unit tests
cd src/MathStorm && dotnet test

# 2. Start application
cd src/MathStorm/MathStorm.Web && dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:5000"

# 3. Playwright tests (requires browser installation)
npx playwright install
npx playwright test

# 4. Manual test execution
# Follow TestHarness/MathStorm-Manual-Test-Plan.md

# 5. HTTP testing
# Use VS Code REST Client with TestHarness/MathStorm-HTTP-Tests.http
```

## Test Results Summary

### Unit Test Results:
```
Test run for MathStorm.Tests.dll (.NETCoreApp,Version=v8.0)
Passed!  - Failed: 0, Passed: 26, Skipped: 0, Total: 26, Duration: 869 ms
```

### Application Validation:
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ HTTP endpoints respond correctly (200 OK)
