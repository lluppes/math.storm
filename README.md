# Lyle's Math Storm Game Suite

Too often these days we let the computers and calculators and phones do all of the mental arithmetic for us,
and that skill of being able to estimate with mental math is a skill that is quickly fading away and needs
to be developed in order to succeed in life. Maybe this game will help you develop that skill!

## Game Interfaces

Math Storm is available in multiple interfaces to suit your preference:

- **🌐 Web Application** ([src/web](src/web/)) - Blazor Server app with rich UI
- **💻 Console Application** ([src/console](src/console/)) - Beautiful command-line interface using Spectre.Console  
- **⚙️ Functions API** ([src/functions](src/functions/)) - Azure Functions backend for all game operations

## Introduction

This repository is an example of deploying a .NET 8 application suite into Azure. The game challenges you to mental math exercises with real-time scoring and leaderboards.  

> Note: this game was entirely coded using the GitHub Copilot Agent, guided by prompts and instructions from the developer. A very few lines were tweaked manually because of it was easier than writing a prompt (like the About page text), but the 99.9% of the code was generated by the AI.

This project is intended as a good example of using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy and manage the Azure resources, utilizing [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) to deploy Azure resources declaratively.

The project also has fully automated CI/CD pipelines to deploy both the infrastructure and the application, so you can literally run one pipeline and have it create the Azure Resources, build the program, unit test the program, deploy the program to Azure, and run [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/) smoke tests after it is deployed.

The pipelines and actions are all built modularly using templates, so you can snap them into new pipelines or use them in other projects.
